This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: attempting to copy a file that doesn't exist.  The original Dockerfile fails to build because requirements.txt is not present in the context when the COPY command is executed.  The solution shows how to correctly manage the requirements file to ensure a successful build.  This is crucial for reproducible builds and efficient container deployment.
